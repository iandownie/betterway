Indeed, red tape is an empire in its own right. There are no limits to the amount of regulatory costs Washington can impose each year. Few old regulations are taken off the books. And where we see new sources of innovation—from energy to the Internet itself—regulators see new chances for control. Even Congress is complicit, having delegated broad authority to unelected bureaucrats. Regulators can regulate first and never have to answer questions later, while you have little recourse or say in the process.
