That's what A Better Way is about. It is a full slate of ideas to address some of the biggest challenges of our time. Developed with input from around the country, it looks past this president to what we can achieve in 2017 and beyond. It is our vision for a confident America, at home and abroad. It is a clear and compelling choice for our future."

Over the years, Washington has made many promises, created many programs, and spent many trillions to fight poverty.

Washington measures success by how many programs it creates, not by how many people it helps. The system traps families in a cycle of poverty, shuffling them from program to program instead of helping them break free altogether.",
